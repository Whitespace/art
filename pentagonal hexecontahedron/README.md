# Pentagonal Hexecontahedron

Gonna make this because

- all 60 faces are the same
    - only have to model one Â» faster iteration, faster printing
- the floret patterns are visually interesting
- it has 60 faces
    - means more interesting gradients/patterns could be seen
    - you can see 22-30 faces at once
    - Rhomboi had 30 faces, and you could only see 10-13 of them at once

This repo will contain the STL files of the different iterations that I print.  There will be flat and rounded versions of the finalized model.  It will **not** contain Chitubox layouts.

## Features

- curved or flat faces
- tongue-in groove guides to align pieces
- sloped LED shoulders to align LED depth
- enough room on the inside to house batteries
- everything has a fillet to reduce internal stresses in cured resin
- fully parametric model in Fusion 360
    - overall diameter
    - cell thickness (diffusion)
